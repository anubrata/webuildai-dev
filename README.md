# WeBuildAi
web platfrom for the WeBuildAi

To do:
- Make about page show up every time a person logs in
- brent: integrate add feature part
- right before the pairwise comparison --> make 1 column instead of 2 (the selected feature part)
- make no default for radio button 
- require an input before moving on to the next page (same for the about page)
- check this: social preferences page needs to be added (and needs to use driver preference)
- make sure that if all input weights are zero then it doesn't let you go forward
- change exit survey to say NEXT
- as soon as you finish the pairwise comparison part have a completion page
- exit survey link page
- add all content from the wireframes to the website
- !!!!!!!!!!!! all features added are global but needs to be just for that one user !!!!!!!!!!!!
