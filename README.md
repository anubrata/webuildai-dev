# WeBuildAi
web platfrom for the WeBuildAi

Serious Issues
- all features added are global but needs to be just for that one user // michael
- add a page to select social preferences as well and pairwise comparison features need to be from this page // michael

Kinda important
- make sure that if all input weights are zero then it doesn't let you go forward // 
- make no default for radio button // 
- require an input before moving on to the next page (same for the about page) // 

easy
- michael: Make about page show up every time a person logs in
- brent: integrate add feature part
- add all content from the wireframes to the website //
- exit survey link page //
- as soon as you finish the pairwise comparison part have a completion page // 
- change exit survey to say NEXT // 
- check this: social preferences page needs to be added (and needs to use driver preference) // 
- right before the pairwise comparison --> make 1 column instead of 2 (the selected feature part) //
